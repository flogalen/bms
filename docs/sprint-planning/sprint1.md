# Sprint 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture

## Objectives
* Establish the development environment, repository, and CI/CD pipelines.
* Define and document the technical architecture and technology stack.
* Create initial wireframes/prototypes for key UI components.
* Implement a basic security framework (authentication, 2FA basics, and encryption).
