# Sprint 1 Review & Retrospective

## Accomplishments

### Repository Setup
- Created and structured the GitHub repository
- Set up branch protection rules and commit guidelines
- Established folder structure for frontend, backend, docs, and tests

### Technology Stack Implementation
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript, shadcn/ui, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js with Express and TypeScript, Prisma ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: NextAuth.js for frontend, JWT for backend
- Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose for development environment

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Configured GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- Set up basic test automation

### Technical Architecture & Documentation
- Created comprehensive architecture documentation
- Defined module structures and data flow
- Documented API endpoints and security architecture

### UI Prototyping
- Implemented dashboard wireframe with shadcn/ui components
- Created authentication screens (login, register)
- Established consistent UI patterns and components

### Security Framework
- Implemented JWT-based authentication on the backend
- Integrated NextAuth.js on the frontend
- Set up 2FA infrastructure (basic implementation)
- Configured secure password hashing with bcrypt

### Database Setup
- Configured PostgreSQL with Prisma
- Created initial schema for authentication
- Set up database migrations

## What Went Well
- Successfully established the core technical architecture
- Implementation of shadcn/ui provides a solid foundation for UI development
- Docker setup ensures consistent development environments
- Authentication system includes 2FA from the start

## Challenges Encountered
- Integration between Next.js frontend and Express backend required careful consideration
- Setting up the proper TypeScript configurations took more time than expected

## Lessons Learned
- Starting with a robust authentication system from day one is valuable
- Containerization simplifies development environment consistency
- Strong typing with TypeScript catches many potential issues early

## Planning for Sprint 2: People Module (MVP)
- Implement the adaptive profile template
- Create the interaction logging system
- Begin development of AI learning suggestions for fields
- Integrate with the authentication system

## Action Items
1. Finalize any remaining security configurations
2. Complete unit tests for backend authentication
3. Review and update architecture documentation based on implementation decisions
4. Prepare detailed user stories for Sprint 2
